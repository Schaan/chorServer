## Short Introduction

+ In MuniChor there is a sub-program with name of Tadpoles with orientation of a-capella arrangements. After the last regroup in chorus the Tadpoles' Project works as a pioneer for testing every new idea in matters of the whole group. `chorhackers` tends to be tested at first with recording ressources from Tadpoles and be considered as a showcase.
